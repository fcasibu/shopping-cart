## Lessons Learned

I've learn ed about how I can utilize routes in order to navigate between different URLs to display different components to the web. There's also testing in react which actually took a lot of time to learn and all of it aren't sinking yet, hopefully I can improve my unit testings in the future. I'm happy with the outcome, i'll come back to it to refactor.
